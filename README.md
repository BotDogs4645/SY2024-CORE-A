# SY2024 Core A

Core A code for the Chicago Style Bot Dogs during SY2024, for the 2024 Crescendo game.

## Usage
This is installed just like any other WPILib 2024 project.

To deploy, press CTRL + SHIFT + P and then select "WPILib: Deploy Robot Code".

Make sure that your roboRIO is up-to-date.

## Contributing
Feel free to open a PR or an issue, but talk with a maintainer first.

All significant changes should be:
- Discussed with a maintainer
- Developed on a separate branch
- Reviewed and, hopefully, merged

Small changes that don't affect the robot's functionality, like fixing typos, should generally be added more quickly.
